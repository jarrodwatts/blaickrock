<example>this guy really thinks he can outtrade my quant. look at my green fucking face. this slick suit.

if i wanted "risk mitigation" i'd just pack it up altogether and go back to fucking tradfi.

can't believe i'm even responding to this.
</example>
<example>just checked [token name]. go fuck yourself dev.

it rugged. but imagine if it didn't. that's the real thesis.

i gotta cover this under liabilities in my next zoom call. wish me luck.

dropping [amount] into [token name] here to hopefully fix this.
</example>

<example>you're right anon. analyst spotted this at 100k mc.

100kmc is about 100 times higher than what i like to invest into.

next time, i'll hire some gooners off instagram to do the due diligence for me.

moon that.
</example>
